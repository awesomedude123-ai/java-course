 * Lesson 3 Objectives
* 1). 5 is an int and 5.0 is a double.
* 2). False, the default value for boolean variables is 'false'.
* 3). "1" is a string while 1 is an int. They are different data types and thus have different functions and abilities. 
* 4). 1 â‰  "1" because they are each of different data types.
